# Mastering Java

Hello, fellow internet human! üëã

What you'll see below is a log for every program I have done to Make my java Stronger . ( The Log Keep Updating With More Content)

## Basic Syntax and Data Types üê£
| Serial No                       | Name                                                                                                              |    Description 
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|    1    | Hello World |       The gateway to the coding universe! üöÄ Your very first step into the world of programming‚Äîwhere it all begins.                                        |
|    2    | Declaring Variables |       The foundation of every program! Learn how to store and manipulate data using variables ‚Äì the building blocks of Java.                          |
|    3    | Type Casting  |       Transforming data like a pro! Learn how to convert one data type into another‚Äîbecause sometimes, even Java needs a little flexibility.      |
|    4    | Swapping of two variables |       Implemented a smart swapping technique using arithmetic eliminating the need for a third variable and optimizing memory usage.                          |
|    5    | Sum of N Natural Number |       Implemented an optimized approach to calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers using loop-based iteration                          |
|    6    | Arithmetic Operations |       Implemented a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus) on two numbers.                          |
|    7    | Calculating the Area of Different Shapes |         Implemented a program that finds the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle based on user input.                      |
|    8    | Calculating String length |         Implemented a program to get a String from the user and find it's length Without using length() Method.                     |

## Conditional Statements and Loops ‚ö°üîÑ
| Serial No                       | Name                                                                                                              |    Description 
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|    9    | Factorial of a Number  |         Implemented a program to Calculate the Factorial of a number after taking input from the User                  |
|    10    | Checking if number is positive or not |         Implemented a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else conditions.                     |
